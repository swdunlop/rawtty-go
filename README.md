Rawtty-Go is a fork of [Termbox-Go][nsf] that only provides raw TTY input functions, and
leaves output as an exercise for the application.  This allows a wider range
of terminal applications, such as REPL's and pagers.  It is not intended as
a replacement of Termbox, which provides a sophisticated framebuffer-like
display model.
